# ibm-mq-kotlin-concurrency
### FOR WHAT
I am backend developer and when I started using Kotlin, I constantly lacked examples of how it can be used for enterprise backend tasks.
This example shows how you can use Kotlin and channels for asynchronous processing of IBM MQ messages in non-hierarchical CSP style, and ofcourse you can replace it with another MQ manager.


#### Also
For understand how MessageWorker class is work
I  recommend watch Roman Elizarov talk about this pattern from KotlinConf 2018  `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3agLJQ6vt8`
and after read this Roman article ` https://medium.com/@elizarov/deadlocks-in-non-hierarchical-csp-e5910d137cc`
